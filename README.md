**Project and experiments**

- [Kode-Keeper](https://kode-keeper.netlify.app/) - Worked on this project markdown editor and previewer. Many existing editors were bolted with features, still lacking functionalities like text-to-speech and comprehensive code syntax highlighting. So, to solve this i built keeper!!

- [TODO-Buddy](https://github.com/ooye-sanket/todo-buddy)(Vs.code Extension) - it's inbuild in vscode itself! It's frustrating to find todo application mannually and control it. To make your life easier, I've created a VScode extension to solve this problem!.
  
- [DejaVu](https://github.com/ooye-sanket/Deja-vu) - Never struggle to remember your bookmarks again! Deja Vu, an AI-powered Chrome extension, seamlessly finds bookmarks‚Äîjust jot down any vague details, and it effortlessly locates them for you.
